{"pred": " The discussion focused on how to select channels for the new remote control. The consensus was that people tend to use only a few channels, typically 4-5, and therefore the remote control should allow users to set up their preferred channels and automatically switch between them. The designers proposed having a menu with buttons for the main channels and a screen to display the full channel list. Users could then select their preferred channels by pressing the corresponding button or using voice commands like \"channel 5\". The designers also considered adding speech recognition to allow users to simply say \"channel 5\" instead of pressing a button.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels.
